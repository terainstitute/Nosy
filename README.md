## &#9658; About: 

### Nosy is a tool for journalists and researchers to gather and evaluate more open source intelligence (OSINT) with less technical knowledge and code. For example, Nosy can will be able to crawl websites of multiple ORGs and relate the results using Named Entity Recognition (NER) in a network graph for further investigation (similar to Maletgo or Gotham). The project is extremly early. This repo only has first codesnippets in a jupyter lab environment. Use at own risk.
